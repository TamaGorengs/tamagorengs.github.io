Hello there! I'm **TamaGorengs**, a passionate CyberSecurity Enthusiast hailing from Malaysia ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾. My journey in Cybersecurity has been entirely self-taught, where I've utilized a plethora of resources such as [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/), [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com/), [HackTheBox Academy](https://academy.hackthebox.com/), [TCM Academy](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/), and of course YouTube. Through this blog, I intend to share my learning experiences, detailed writeups, valuable tools, and exciting plans for the future.

I believe that even if a single person gains **inspiration** or benefits from my blog, it would make a world of difference to me. My ultimate aspiration is to inspire others to explore the fascinating world of **Cybersecurity**. So, let's embark on this thrilling journey together! Thank you for joining me, and keep pushing the boundaries of knowledge!"
